                <h2>You've Tried Everything, Haven't You?</h2>
                <p>The expensive creams that promised to turn back the clock. The painful injections that left you looking frozen instead of fresh. The endless skincare routines that took up hours of your day but delivered nothing but disappointment.</p>
                
                <p>And the worst part? You're watching the years add up in the mirror. The sagging around your jawline. The fine lines that seem to multiply overnight. The puffiness that makes you look tired even when you're not.</p>
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the beauty industry keeps selling you the same tired solutions: more creams, more procedures, more money down the drain. They want you to believe that aging is inevitable and that the only way to fight it is to keep spending.</p>

                    <p class="intro-text">Hi, I'm Trinh Georg, and I used to feel exactly like you do right now.</p>
                    
                    <p>After both of my pregnancies, I struggled with postpartum depression and watched my face lose its tone and vitality. I tried every cream on the market. Nothing worked.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then I had a realization that changed everything: <strong>If I could get my body back with exercise, why couldn't I do the same for my face?</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Your face has over 40 muscles, and just like the muscles in your body, they need to be trained. When these muscles weaken, your skin loses support, leading to sagging, wrinkles, and that tired appearance you're trying to fight.</p>
                    
                    <p class="solution-highlight">That's when I created Facelates—a revolutionary face training system that works with your body's natural structure to lift, tone, and sculpt your face from the inside out.</p>
